# (Python Package + Agentic Coding) Cookiecutter Template

_Forked from https://github.com/JnyJny/python-package-cookiecutter_

There are many [cookiecutter][cookiecutter] [templates][templates],
but this one is mine and I'm sharing it with you. Create complete Python 
packages with zero configuration - including CLI, testing, documentation, 
and automated PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions. 

**crossjam supplemental commentary**

This cookiecutter template has been, and is continually, extended to
incorporate support for agentic coding. A stock AGENTS.md and
CLAUDE.md are added to the generated as a start. There’s a nod towards
structure that I’ve found useful, e.g. a plans directory. Further
features, like selecting AI package dependencies, forthcoming. 

The goal is to generate a cut, connect to one of the more popular
agentic coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI), and start
generating code.


## Features

- **Zero Configuration CI/CD** - Complete GitHub Actions workflows for testing, 
  building, and publishing to PyPI
- **CLI Ready** - [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com) CLI with help and autocompletion
- **Fast Dependencies** - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for lightning-fast package management
- **Quality Tools** - Pre-configured ruff, ty, pytest, and coverage reporting
- **Documentation** - [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with auto-deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Flexible** - Optional Pydantic settings, multiple build backends, cross-platform testing

## Quick Start

### Create Your Project

```console
# With uvx (recommended)
uvx cookiecutter gh:crossjam/agentic-project-cookiecutter

# Or with pip
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:crossjam/agentic-project-cookiecutter
```

### Start Developing

```console
cd your-new-project
poe --help          # See all available tasks
poe qc              # Run quality checks
poe test            # Run tests
poe publish_patch   # Release to PyPI
```

**That's it!** Your package is now live on PyPI with documentation deployed to 
GitHub Pages.
